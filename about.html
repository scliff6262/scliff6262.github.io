<p>At 23, I began feeling the inertia that is commonly felt by those working in the food service industry. "Do I want to do this for the rest of my life?" "Will I ever find something that I'm passionate about?" After 7+ years in the restaurant/bar business, I knew it was time to move on. Discovering code was a godsend for me. The challenges it brings on a daily basis allows me to use a part of my brain that had, admittedly, laid dormant for several years. Through this blog, I plan to discuss these challenges, their solutions, and the sense of both accomplishment and purpose this career change has brought to my life. (And hopefully, I can inspire somebody else, too!)</p>
