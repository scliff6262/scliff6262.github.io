Once my Sinatra project was complete, I thought I was the real deal. After finally creating something that felt *close*  to a real-world web application with relative ease, I thought, "how much harder can Rails be?" Well guess what, it was harder! However, even from the very beginning of Rails, one can see how powerful it is, especially when compared to Sinatra. 

"With great power, comes great responsibility," said Peter Parker's uncle (I think). Honestly, this should be the official slogan for Rails. The amount of power, and seemingly magic, provided by Rails was/is overwhelming to me. Every issue I encountered while creating my *kickUP* Rails project, led me down another rabbit hole filled with Stack Overflow, APIdock, and RailsGuide posts. This led to several head-scratching moments, and times where I wasn't sure if I had chosen the "right" solution, but then I finally came to the realization: *this is all part of the process.*

I have read countless interviews and articles about web developers and one constant theme is one's ability to use these guides, and to be a good "Googler." After this project, I understand that more than ever. Learn to trust this process. Understand that getting stuck will be a part of your daily routine going forward as a developer. Discovering different helpers, quickly creating nested routes and learning how to properly seperate concerns using the MVC are most difficult because of the specific conventions that must be followed. Once you realize the patterns in these conventions, it becomes clear that they aren't neccesarily expected to be memorized and that it is okay to use your resources to quickly look something up and ensure its proper application.

This project took almost twice as long as I wanted to, but it has been another great learning experience and stepping stone towards the ultimate goal of graduating from the Flatiron School and becoming a legitimate web developer. After the cirriculum is complete, I look forward to returning to my *kickUP* application and diving even deeper into the magical/confusing world of Ruby-on-Rails.
