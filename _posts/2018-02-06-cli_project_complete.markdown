It's always nice to get the first one out of the way! For my first project at the Flatiron School I chose to create a CLI app that allows users to view the world's top 100 wines (according to www.jamessuckling.com). Having a background in the bar business, and having taken part in the design of a friend's beverage-based app, I figured this would be a good base for building a nice little CLI "Wine Guide"! Plus...who doesn't love wine?

First off I gotta say, watching Avi's explanation on setting up these types of applications was a HUGE help. He constantly talked about writing the code, "you wish that you had." Up until this project, admittedly, I had worked in the opposite direction. I most likely would have built my scraper object first, and tried to shove the data into the command-line in some way, shape, or form. Would it have worked? Probably. But would I have been able to work as efficiently? No way!

With those words of advice echoing in my head, I always felt like there was a good sense of direction in my application's design. When I wrote one method, I already knew what method would be needed next. It gave me foresight that I previously wasn't capable of. My number one takeaway from this project is this: starting from where the user interacts with your software is a great first step, then just like Avi says, write the code you wish you had!

With that being said, this wasn't a completely painless process. Initially I tried to use a different source to pull the data for this wine guide. However, I wasn't aware that pulling data from HTML tables can be more than just a little tricky. After 4 hours of attempting to wrestle with Nokogiri (I lost...badly) I chose to use a different source. So as with any failure, there is a solid scraping-lesson here: *know your source!* 

Now that the anxiety of my first project has subsided, I have a renewed confidence in my ability. Thankfully I have read a hundred times about how much of a rollercoaster this process can be. Ain't that the truth? Every little triumph, no matter how small, can be just enough to push you towards the goal and over the finish line.
