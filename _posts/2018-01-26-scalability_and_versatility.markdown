We've all heard this one before, "Oh so you're going to be a web designer?", and I suppose the easy answer is "Yes." But web development, and coding in general, is so much bigger than that. If coding was just about building apps and websites, it would still be pretty cool, but would it be worth the challenge, financial burden, and overall anxiety of a career change? Probably not. 

In an economy where seemingly everybody has a bachelor's degree, how does one stick out? How does one make a difference? What can a person do to accomplish more than just getting that average job? Learning a skill like coding, and software development can answer all of these questions, and so many more. 

To me, the desire to learn code is two-fold:

Firstly, I wanted to learn something that is relevant, and in-demand. I didn't want to go to college and get a general business degree (or equivalent) because it was the, "right thing to do". If you're reading this article, then I'm sure you are well aware that technology and healthcare are two industries with the most rapid growth. Learning a skill that can propel you into one of these indusries is just...*smart*! Code is everywhere. It is all-ecompassing. Software has helped to increase the productivity of our economy and continues to do so at almost an alarming pace. However technology isn't all about economics.

The second, and true reason, that learning code is so important to me is this: *scalability*. Today, sharing a great idea with the world is just a "few" lines of code away. No matter who you are, or where you come from, code and software can turn an idea into a reality like nothing else in the history of mankind. Now, there is another "-ility" that comes to mind, *versatility*. Software can be used in every industry, for an infinite amount of causes, anywhere in the world. To me, that is the magic! As we all know, constant change is a guarantee (*insert corny clich√© here*), and in my opinion there are NO skills that one can learn that match code in terms of being prepared for the future, and being able to make as big an impact as possible in our ever-changing world.

Who wouldn't want to be a part of that?
