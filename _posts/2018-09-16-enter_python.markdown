One of my favorite parts about coding is that there is never a lack of new material, or new things to learn. In fact, there is such a plethora of technologies, languages and libraries that it can be challenging to choose which "wormhole" that you want to head down. For me, Javascript was the first language I really dove into. What drew me to JS is its accesibility and its popularity. There is so much content and so many resources available to learn Javascript that you can spend months just digging through new stuff. After deciding to attend a coding bootcamp to focus my learning, I encountered Ruby. It was so refreshing to go through the beginnings of learning a new language and understanding the concepts behind data types, loops, and variables. 

* One of the first things I'd read about learning code is that the first language is the hardest to learn. Having to wrap your head around some of these more esoteric ideas is tough when you are coming from a non-technical background. Couple that with the need to properly learn the language's syntax and you've got a nice little challenge on your hands. But, I digress. Not only was Ruby fun to learn because it was my second language, but the way it is designed is *so* user-friendly. After learning Ruby and some of its libraries (Rails, Sinatra), I wanted to take a look at some other back-end languages, and with Python being really hot right now, I figured it is the best bet. 

Even though Python is trending right now, it is not merely a fad. Python was created in 1991, which is four years before Matz created Ruby. Since then, Python has been on a constant upward trend. Today, Python is utilized as a multi-purpose language, and is commonly found in desktop applications, web apps, data visualization, and even machine learning. *This* is why Python is super-exciting to me. Having learned a proper stack to build full-scale web applications is a great first step into code, however Python is found everywhere, and closer to tech's cutting edge. 

Right now, I have just started a really cool Udemy course on Python and after getting through the first section, I'm already loving this language. In a couple weeks I look forward to putting some small web apps together with Flask or Django and then eventually getting in to some more advanced concepts, like machine learning and native software. Code is exciting to me because it takes you off the sidelines, and into the game. Instead of seeing new and innovative products on CNET and other tech publications, coding gives you the ability to take part in the creation and development of those products, and to me Python is a great tool to have in my toolbox to get me closer to that goal. Next week I'll be writing a quick post to talk a little more about its basic concepts and data types. Have a great week!
