Enjoy the fruit of your labor! 

Learning how to code, and the skills neccesary to become a web developer, is a rollercoaster of an experience. There are days where you wonder how you can accomplish what seems like a tremendous task and coming from a non-technical background can make the process even more daunting.

After completing my first-ever program a month ago, I was SUPER excited. I felt like Neil Armstrong after creating a little command line "wine guide". So, despite turning 25 in two months, I instantly channeled my innter 5-year-old and naturally, I wanted to show my parents. I popped open my laptop next to my father, and said, "check out this CLI app!" He gave me a very confused look. Then I came to the stark realization that he did not know what a CLI, or even a command line, was. 

After showing my dad, I showed my mother, my girlfriend, and a couple of friends. Similiar, unimpressed reactions. *Sigh.* In a world where everybody stares at iPhone all day, a CLI application (although a major accomplishment to a student attending a coding bootcamp) just isn't going to trigger the reaction that I desired, and kind of needed.

Now here we are a month later and I have completed my first Sinatra project, and although I don't think it will garner a million users anytime soon, it is nice to have something that looks a little more, *familiar*. Being able to use Sinatra routes to execute my code and display data in the browser has been the most fulfilling experince in my coding journey thus far.

Trying to understand how Active Record, SQL, Rack, Sinatra, and the browser work together is borderline mind-boggling. When it felt like I was at the lowest point of this metaphorical rollercoaster, I just kind of "embraced" the confusion. Allow the dozens of questions whizzing around your head guide your learning. Its okay to step away from the cirriculum to watch some YouTube videos that talk about ActiveRecord, or even to read some Sinatra documentation. It may take a while, but it *will* click, I promise. When it does, you'll be able to create something that you can be proud of, and that won't confuse the hell out of your friends and family. It might just be the motivation you need next time your rollercoaster is in a nose-dive.
